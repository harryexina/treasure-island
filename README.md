# 🏝️ Treasure Island Adventure

**Treasure Island** is a beginner-friendly, text-based adventure game written in Python.  
This project was created as a learning exercise while studying Python fundamentals.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This game is part of my Python learning journey and was built to practice:

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- User input handling (`input()`)
- String methods like `.lower()` 
- Basic program flow and logic
- Console output formatting and ASCII art

It is intentionally simple and focuses on clarity and learning rather than advanced features.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The player makes choices that determine the outcome of the game:

- Choose paths at crossroads
- Decide whether to swim or wait
- Pick doors inside a mysterious castle
- Some choices lead to treasure, others to traps

The goal is to **find the hidden treasure** 🏆
